Colletion:- A group of individual object as a Single entity is called collection.

Colletion Framework:-It define Several classes and interface,which can be used to represent a group of object as a single entity.

Terminology:-
		java						C++
	Colletion				 Container
	Colletion Framework		 STL(standrad Templet library)
	
9-key interface of colletion framework:-

  1. Collection(Interface):-
		1. If we want to represent a group of individual object as a single entity then we should go for colletion.
		2. In general colletion interface is consider as root interface of colletion framework.
		3. colletion interface define the most comman metohds which can be applicable for any collection object.
		3.Collection is an Interface can be used to represent a group of individual object as a single entity where as 
		4.collections an utility class present in java.util package to define several utility method for collection.
		
  2. List(Interface):-
		1. It is the child interface of collection.
		2. If we want to represent a group of individual object where insertion odrer is preserved and duplication allowed.Then we should go for list.
		3. Vector and stack classes are engineereed in 1.2 version to into collection framework.
		
  3. Set(Interface):-
		1. It is the child interface of collection.
		2. If we want to represent a group of individual object where duplication not allowed and insertion odrer is not preserved.Then we should go for set.
		
  4. SortedSet(Interface):-
		1. It is the child interface of collection.
		2. If we want to represent a group of individual object according to some sorting order.then we should go for SortedSet.
  
  5. NegvigableSet(Inteface):- 
		1.  It is the child interface of SortedSet.to provide Several method for Negvigable purpose.
		2. It is introduce in version 1.6.
		
  6. Queue(Inreface):- 
		1.It is the child interface of collection.
		2. If we want to represent a group of individual object prior to processing ,then we should we go for queue.
		
	Note:- 1. All the above interface(collection,list,set,SortedSet,NegvigableSet,Queue) means for represent group individual object.
		   2. If we want to represent a group of object as key-value pairs then we should go for Map.
		   
  7. Map(Interface):- 
		   1. If we want to represent a group of object as a key-value pairs then we should we go for Map.
		   2. Both key and value are object.
		   3. duplication are not allowed But value can be duplicate.
		   4. HashMap is not child interface of collection.
		   
  8. SortedMap(Interface):-
           1. If we want to represent a group of object as a key-value pairs.according to some sorting order then we should we go for SortedMap.
		   2. Sorting should be done only based on keys but not based on values.
		   3. SortedMap is child interface if Map.
		   
  9. NegvigableMap(Inteface):- 
	       1. It is child interface of SortedMap and define Several method for Negvigable purpose.
