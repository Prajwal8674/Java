LinkedList:-
	1. The underlaying datastructure is doubleLinkedList.
	2. Java LinkedList class uses doubly linked list to store the elements. It extends the AbstractList class and implements List and Deque interfaces.
	3. Java LinkedList class can contain duplicate elements.
	4. Insertion order is preserved.
	5. Java LinkedList class is non synchronized.
	6. Null Insertion is possible.
	7. Implement serializable and clonable interface bot not random access interface.
	8. Bit it suitable for frequent insertion and delition in the middle.
	9. worrest choce if our frequent operation is retrival.
	10. Java LinkedList class can be used as list, stack or queue.
	11. In Java LinkedList class, manipulation is fast because no shifting needs to be occurred.
	
	
	Contruction:-
	1. LinkedList l= new LinkedList(); //create an empty linkedList object.
	2. LinkedList l = new LinkedList(Collection c); // for interconversion between Colletion object
	
	LinkedList sepcific method:- Usually we can LinkedList to implements stack and dequeue to support this requirement LinkedList class define thee following 
		size specific method.
			
		1. void addFirst(Object o);
		2. void addLast(Object o);
		3. Object removeFirst();
		4. Object removeLast();
		5. Object getFirst();
		6. Object getLast();
	
	Difference between ArrayList and LinkedList:-ArrayList and LinkedList both implements List interface and maintains insertion order. Both are non synchronized
			classes.But there are many differences between ArrayList and LinkedList classes that are given below.
			
			ArrayList																	LinkedList
1) ArrayList internally uses dynamic array to store the elements.			LinkedList internally uses doubly linked list to store the elements.
2) Manipulation with ArrayList is slow because it internally uses array.	If any element is removed from the array, all the bits are shifted in memory.Manipulation with LinkedList is faster than ArrayList because it uses doubly linked list so no bit shifting is required in memory.
3) ArrayList class can act as a list only because it implements List only.	LinkedList class can act as a list and queue both because it implements List and Deque interfaces.
4) ArrayList is better for storing and accessing data.						LinkedList is better for manipulating data.
6) Multipal thread can access ArrayList simultaneously.Hance ArrayList 		At any point only one Thread is allowed to operate on Vector object at a time.hance vector is thread safe.
	object is not threadSafe.
