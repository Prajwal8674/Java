Difference between ArrayList and Vector

	ArrayList and Vector both implements List interface and maintains insertion order.But there are many differences between ArrayList and Vector classes that
	are given below.

		ArrayList																	Vector
1) ArrayList is not synchronized.									Vector is synchronized.
2) ArrayList increments 50% of current array size if number 		Vector increments 100% means doubles the array size if total number of element exceeds than its capacity.
of element exceeds from its capacity.	
3) ArrayList is not a legacy class, it is introduced in JDK 1.2.	Vector is a legacy class.
4) ArrayList is fast because it is non-synchronized.				Vector is slow because it is synchronized i.e. in multithreading environment, it will hold the other threads in runnable or non-runnable state until current thread releases the lock of object.
5) ArrayList uses Iterator interface to traverse the elements.		Vector uses Enumeration interface to traverse the elements. But it can use Iterator also.
