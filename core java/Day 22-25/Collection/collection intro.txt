An Array is an index collection of fixed no & homogeneous data element.

limitatons of object array:-

 1. Array are fixed in size i.e once we are created an array these is no change of increment or decreasing size based on our requirement hance to uses array 
		concept compulsary we should know the size in advance, which may not be possible.
		
 2. Array can hold only homogeneousdata element i.e ( same type).
	
	Example:- Student[] s = new Student[1000];
			  Student[0] =  new Student[];
			  Student[1] =  new Student[];
			  Student[2] =  new Custmer[];// incompatible type found custmer required Student

			But we can resolve this problem by using onject type of array
			Object[] a = new Object[1000];
			a[0] = new Student[];
			a[1] = new Student[];
			
 3. Array concept not built on some datastructure,Hance readymade method are not available for every requirement compulsary programmer is responsible to write the logic.
		to resolve this problem intorduce collection concept.

	Advantages of colletion over arrays:-
		1. Collection are growable in nature Hace based on our requirement we can increase or decrease the size.
		2. Collection can hold homogeneous and hetrogeneous.
		3. Every collection class is implement based on some datastructure Hance radymade method support is available for every requirement.
		
	Disadvantages of collection;-
	 1. performance point of view collection are not recommended to use.
	 
	Diffrence between Array and colletion 
	
			Array 																Colletion
			
	1. Array are fixed in size. 								    				1. collection are gorwable in nature.
	2. Memory pont of view array concept is not recommended to use. 				2. Memory pont of view colletion concept is recommended to use.
	3. Performance pont of view array concept highly recommended to use.			3. Performance pont of view colletion concept is not recommended to use.
	4. Array can hold only homogeneous data element.								4. Collection can hold only homogeneous and hetrogeneous object.
	5. There is no underlaying d.s for array Hance radymade method is not available.5. underlaying d.s is available for every collection class.Hance radymade method is available.
	6. Array can be used to premitive And object.									6. collection can hold only object bot not for primitive.
