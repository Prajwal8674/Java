String ;- Most of data that transmits on internet will be in the form of group of characters, 
		  such group of character is called as string.
		  In c/c++ language, a string is represented an array of character, where the last character
		  will be '\0'(called null character).this last character is represented the end of the string.
		  But this is not valid in java , a string is an object of String class.
		  
		  An array of characters works same as java string. For example:
		  String s = "Java"
		  char[] ch={'J','a','v','a'};  

What is String :- string is a sequence of character .But in java,string is an object that represents a 
				  sequence of character. String class is used to create string object.

How to create String object :- There are three way to create string in Java

1. By string Literal.
2. By new keyword.
3. By converting the character array into string.

1. By create String literal :- Java String literal is created by using double quotes. 
	For Example:- String s = "Hello";
	
	In this case JVM create an object and store "Hello" in that object. this object is referenced by the variable 's'.
	create object means allotting memory for storing data.
	Each time you create a string literal, the JVM checks the string constant pool first.If the string is exist in the pool,
	a reference to the pooled instance is returned. If string doesn't exist in the pool, a new string instance is created 
	and placed in the pool. For example:
	
	String s1="Hello";  
	String s2="Hello";//will not create new instance  
	
2.  By new keyword:- We can create an object to String class by allocating memory using new operator.This is just like creating
	object to any class.
	For Example:- String s = new String("Hello");
	Here we are doing two things.First we are creating object using new operator.Then we are storing the string "Hello" into object.
	
3. By converting the character array into string :- the third way of creating string is by converting character array into strings.
	For Example:- char[] ch={'J','a','v','a'};  	
					String s = new String(ch);
	
	
Substring:- A part of a String is called substring.In other words,substring is a subset of another string.In case of substring
            startIndex is inclusive and endIndex is exclusive.
			
			String s="hello";  
            System.out.println(s.substring(0,2));//he

			String s="Sachin Tendulkar";  
            System.out.println(s.substring(6));//Tendulkar  
            System.out.println(s.substring(0,6));//Sachin 
			
		1.UpperCase() and toLowerCase() method:-The java string toUpperCase() method converts this string into uppercase letter and string
												toLowerCase() method into lowercase letter.	
			String s="Sachin";  
			System.out.println(s.toUpperCase());//SACHIN  
			System.out.println(s.toLowerCase());//sachin  
				 
		2. trim() method:-The string trim() method eliminates white spaces before and after string.
			String s="  Sachin  ";  
			System.out.println(s);//  Sachin    
			System.out.println(s.trim());//Sachin
			
		3. replace() method:-The string replace() method replaces all occurrence of first sequence of character with second sequence of character.
			String s1="Java is a programming language. Java is a platform. Java is an Island.";    
            String replaceString=s1.replace("Java","Kava");//replaces all occurrences of "Java" to "Kava"    
           System.out.println(replaceString);
		  
		4. charAt() method:-The string charAt() method returns a character at specified index.
			String s="Sachin";  
			System.out.println(s.charAt(0));//S  
			System.out.println(s.charAt(3));//h
