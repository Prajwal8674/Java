Array :- Array is a collection of similar type of element that's have a contiguous memory location. 
		 Array is an object the contains element of similar data type We can store only fixed set of
		 element in a java array.Array in java is index based.first element of the array is store at 
		 0 index.Each item in an array is called an element,and each element is accessed by its numerical
		 index.
			
		Instead of declaring individual variables, such as number0, number1, ..., and number99,you declare
		one array variable such as numbers and use numbers[0], numbers[1], and ..., numbers[99] to represent
		individual variables.
		
limitation of Array :- 1. fixed in size
		       2. Homogeneous
		       3. But we can resolve this problem using object Arrays.

Types of Array :- Array are generally categorized into two parts as describe here's
				  Single dimensional Array(1D Array).
				  Multidimensional Array(2D,3D,.... arrays).
				  
		1. Single dimensional Array :- A single dimensional array or 1D array is represents  a row or a column of element.	
	for example,the marks is obtained by a student in 5 different subject can be represent 
									by 1D array
									
		Syntax to Declare an Array in java:- dataType[] arrname; (or)  
						     dataType []arrname; (or)  
                                                     dataType arrname[];  
											 
Example :- 	int a[]=new int[5];//declaration and instantiation  
			a[0]=10;//initialization  
			a[1]=20;  
			a[2]=70;  
			a[3]=40;  
			a[4]=50;


			int a[]={33,3,4,5};//declaration, instantiation and initialization  

Multidimensional Array(2D,3D,.... arrays) :- multi dimensional array represent 2D,3D  array  which are combination of several
											 earlier type of array. for example, a 2D array is a combination of two or more 1D
											 arrays. exactly for this 3D array.
											 
Systex :- int[][] arr=new int[3][3];

Example :- int[][] arr=new int[3][3];//3 row and 3 column  
			
	       arr[0][0]=1;  
		   arr[0][1]=2;  
		   arr[0][2]=3;  
		   arr[1][0]=4;  
           arr[1][1]=5;  
		   arr[1][2]=6;  
		   arr[2][0]=7;  
           arr[2][1]=8;  
		   arr[2][2]=9; 
		   
		   int arr[][]={{1,2,3},{2,4,5},{4,4,5}};  
		   
		   
Arrayname.length :- If we want to know the sizeof an any array, we can use the property of 'length'  of an any array.
					arrayname.lenght return an integer number whihc is represent the size of an array.
