What is an interface?
An interface is a specification of method prototypes. All the methods of the interface are pUblic and
abstraCt.

Why the methods of interface are public and abstract by default?
Interface methods are public since they shoald be available to third party vendors to provide
implementation. They are abstract becau.se their implementation is left for third party vendors.

Q) Multiple inheritance is not supported through class in java but it is possible by interface, why?

As we have explained in the inheritance chapter, multiple inheritance is not supported in case of class.
But it is supported in case of interface because there is no ambiguity as implementation is provided by the implementation class. 

Q) What is marker or tagged interface?

An interface that have no member is known as marker or tagged interface. For example: Serializable, Cloneable, Remote etc. 
They are used to provide some essential information to the JVM so that JVM may perform some useful operation.
