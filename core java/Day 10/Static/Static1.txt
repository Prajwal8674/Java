2. Static method :-static method is a method that does not act upon instance variables of a class.A static method is
declared by using the keyword 'static. Static methods are ca1led using Classname.methodname().
the reason why.static methods can not act on instance variables is that the JVM first execute the
static methods and then only create the objects. Since the objects are not available at the time of
calling the static methods, the instance variables are also not available.If you apply static keyword with any method,

1. A static method belongs to the class rather than object of a class.
2. A static method can be invoked without the need for creating an instance of a class.
