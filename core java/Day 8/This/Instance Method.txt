Instance Method:-Instance method are the method which act upon the instance variable.To call the instance
object is needed, since the instance variables are contained in the object. We call the instance methods
by using object objectname.methodname(). The specialty of instance methods is that they 
can access not only instance variables but also static variables directly.
There are two types of instance methods:-
1. Asseccor Methods.
2. Mutator Method.
Accessor methods are the methods that simply access or read the instance variables.They do not modify
the instance variables. Mutator methods not only access the instance variables but also modify them.
