Instance initializer block:-Instance Initializer block is used to initialize the instance data member. It run each time when object of the class is created.
The initialization of the instance variable can be directly but there can be performed extra operations while initializing the instance variable in the 
instance initializer block.

Que) What is the use of instance initializer block while we can directly assign a value in instance data member? For example:
class Bike{  
    int speed=100;  
} 

Why use instance initializer block?

Suppose I have to perform some operations while assigning value to instance data member e.g. a for loop to fill a complex array or error handling etc.

There are three places in java where you can perform operations:
method
constructor
block

Rules for instance initializer block :

There are mainly three rules for the instance initializer block. They are as follows:
The instance initializer block is created when instance of the class is created.
The instance initializer block is invoked after the parent class constructor is invoked (i.e. after super() constructor call).
The instance initializer block comes in the order in which they appear.
