Q) Why multiple inheritance is not supported in java?

To reduce the complexity and simplify the language, multiple inheritance is not supported in java.
Consider a scenario where A, B and C are three classes. The C class inherits A and B classes. If A and B classes have same method and you call it from 
child class object, there will be ambiguity to call method of A or B class.

What is inheritance?
Deriving new classes from existing classes such that the new classes acquire all the features of
existing classes is called inheritance.

What is the advantage of inheritance?
In inheritance, a programmer reuses the super class code without rewriting it, in creation of sub
classes. So, developing the classes becomes vel}' easy. Hence, the programmer's protiuctivity is
increased.
